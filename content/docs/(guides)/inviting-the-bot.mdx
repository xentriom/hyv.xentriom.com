## Add HoYoVista to Your Apps

We recommend adding HoYoVista to **My Apps** rather than adding it to a specific server. This allows you to use the bot in DMs and across all your servers.

1. **Open the add link**  
   [Add HoYoVista to My Apps](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1267369071444492309)

2. **Choose "Add to My Apps"**  
   When prompted, select **"Add to My Apps"** instead of "Add to Server". This gives you access to the bot everywhere.

3. **Review permissions**  
   The bot will request the permissions it needs. Approve them to complete the setup.

4. **Authorize**  
   Complete the captcha if shown, then click "Authorize."

Once added to your apps, you can use HoYoVista in DMs or in any server where you have permission. Users still need to `/register` and `/hoyolink` for their own account.

## Using the Bot

After adding to your apps, you can:

- Use commands in **Direct Messages** with the bot
- Use commands in **any server** where you're a member
- Access the bot from anywhere without needing it in a specific server

To get started, use `/register` then `/hoyolink` to link your HoYoLAB account.

## Alternative: Add to Server

If you prefer to add the bot to a specific server instead:

1. Use the same [add link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1267369071444492309)
2. Choose **"Add to Server"** instead
3. Select the server where you have "Manage Server" permission
4. Review and approve permissions

**Note:** We recommend "Add to My Apps" for better flexibility and DM access.

## Permissions

The bot typically needs:

- **Send Messages** – To reply to slash commands
- **Embed Links** – For rich responses
- **Use Application Commands** – For slash commands

Only add from the official link above or from the bot's listing in the Discord app directory to avoid fake/invite phishing.
