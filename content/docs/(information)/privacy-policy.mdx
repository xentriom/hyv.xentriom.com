## Privacy Policy

**HoYoVista is an independent fan project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Cognosphere Pte. Ltd., miHoYo, HoYoverse, or any of their subsidiaries or related entities.** This privacy policy applies only to data collected and processed by HoYoVista. For how Cognosphere and its games handle your data, see their official privacy policies.

### Information We Collect

We may collect and process:

- **Discord data:** Your Discord User ID.
- **Account settings and preferences:** Choices you make in the Bot (e.g., linked accounts, display options).
- **HoYoLAB / game-related data:** If you link your account, we may receive or store data made available via cookies or APIs (e.g., for in-game stats or rewards). This depends on what you choose to share.
- **Usage and logs:** Technical logs (e.g., errors, command usage) and, if you opt in, analytics data to improve the service.

We do not sell your personal information.

### How We Use Your Information

- To provide and operate the Bot (e.g., commands, reminders, linked-account features).
- To improve the Bot's functionality, performance, and user experience.
- For analytics only if you have opted in (e.g., in `/settings`).
- To comply with applicable law or enforce our Terms of Service.

### Data Storage and Security

- Data is stored using industry-standard practices and retained only as long as needed to provide the service.
- We do not guarantee absolute security; you use the Bot at your own risk.
- You can delete or limit your data as described below.

### Your Rights

- **Access:** Use `/data` to view what we store about you.
- **Deletion:** Unlink your account and/or request deletion via `/feedback` or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5rUsSZTyf2); we will process requests in line with applicable law.
- **Opt-out:** Disable analytics and optional data collection in `/settings` where available.

### Third-Party Services

The Bot may rely on third-party services (e.g., Discord, HoYoLAB, hosting providers). Their use of your data is governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for their practices.

### Children

The Bot is not directed at children under 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have done so, please contact us so we can delete it.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance. We may announce material changes via our Discord server or in-Bot notice.
