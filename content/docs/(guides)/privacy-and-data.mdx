## What Data We Store

When you use HoYoVista we may store:

- **Discord ID** – To associate your Discord account with your HoYoVista account.
- **Account settings** – Preferences you set in `/settings` (notifications, privacy blur, analytics, auto check-in/redeem per game).
- **HoYoLAB cookies** – Only if you link your account via `/hoyolink`. Used to call HoYoLAB/HoYoverse APIs on your behalf.
- **Linked game data** – Game IDs, UIDs, regions for the accounts you link.
- **Analytics events** (optional) – If you enable “Collect Analytics Data” in `/settings`: anonymized usage (e.g. command use, check-ins). Used to improve the bot and for features like a yearly “wrapped” summary.

We do not sell your data. See the full [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy) for exact wording.

## How to View Your Data

Use `/data` in Discord. It shows your user data, stored cookies (if linked), linked games, and recent events. The reply is ephemeral (only you see it).

## How to Delete Your Data

- **Unlink HoYoLAB:** Use `/hoyolink` and choose to unlink. This removes your cookies and linked game data. Your Discord-side registration (e.g. settings) may remain until/unless you delete the server/data as below.
- **Full policy:** The [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy) describes how to request full deletion if needed.

## Privacy Blur

In `/settings` you can enable **Privacy Blur**. When enabled, sensitive info (like UIDs) is hidden in bot responses so it’s safer to share screenshots or use the bot in shared channels.

## Terms of Service

Use of HoYoVista is subject to the [Terms of Service](/docs/terms-of-service). By registering and using the bot you agree to those terms.
