## Getting Your HoYoLAB Cookies

To use HoYoVista, you need to link your HoYoLAB account by providing your cookies. This guide will walk you through the process step by step.

### Why Are Cookies Needed?

Cookies are required for HoYoVista to authenticate with HoYoLAB's API on your behalf. They allow the bot to:

- Access your game accounts
- Perform check-ins
- View your profiles and statistics
- Redeem codes
- And more

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Log in to HoYoLAB

1. Go to [HoYoLAB](https://www.hoyolab.com/home)
2. Log in to your account using your credentials

#### Step 2: Open Your Personal Homepage

1. Click on your **profile picture** in the top right corner
2. Select **"Personal Homepage"** from the dropdown menu

#### Step 3: Open Developer Tools

Open your browser's developer tools using one of these methods:

**Chrome/Edge (Windows/Linux):**

- Press `F12`
- Or press `Ctrl + Shift + I`
- Or right-click → **"Inspect"**

**Chrome/Edge (Mac):**

- Press `Cmd + Option + I`
- Or right-click → **"Inspect"**

**Firefox (Windows/Linux):**

- Press `F12`
- Or press `Ctrl + Shift + I`

**Firefox (Mac):**

- Press `Cmd + Option + I`

**Safari (Mac):**

- Enable Developer menu: Preferences → Advanced → "Show Develop menu"
- Press `Cmd + Option + I`

#### Step 4: Navigate to Network Tab

1. In the Developer Tools window, click on the **"Network"** tab
2. Make sure the network tab is visible and ready

#### Step 5: Refresh the Page

1. Refresh the page using `Ctrl + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + R` (Mac)
2. Or click the refresh button in your browser
3. This will capture network requests

#### Step 6: Filter for getGame

1. In the Network tab, look for the **filter/search box**
2. Type **`getGame`** in the filter box
3. You should see a request labeled **"getGameRecordCard"**

#### Step 7: Copy the Cookie

1. Click on the **"getGameRecordCard"** request
2. Look for the **"Request Headers"** section
3. Find the **`Cookie:`** field
4. Copy **everything after the word "Cookie:"** (the entire cookie string)

The cookie string will look something like:

```
ltmid_v2=____; ltoken_v2=v2____; ltuid_v2=____; DEVICEFP=____; ...
```

#### Step 8: Link Your Account

1. Go back to Discord
2. Use the `/hoyolink` command
3. Click **"Add HoYoLAB Account"**
4. Paste the entire cookie string into the text field
5. Submit the form

### Required Cookies

The following cookies are required for the bot to work:

- `ltmidV2` (or `ltmid_v2`)
- `ltokenV2` (or `ltoken_v2`)
- `ltuidV2` (or `ltuid_v2`)

If any of these are missing, you'll get an error message telling you which ones are missing.

### Troubleshooting

**Can't find the getGameRecordCard request?**

- Make sure you're on your Personal Homepage
- Try refreshing the page again
- Check that the Network tab is capturing requests

**Cookies are invalid or incomplete?**

- Make sure you copied the entire cookie string
- Don't include the word "Cookie:" itself
- Try getting fresh cookies by logging out and back in

**No games found?**

- Ensure your HoYoLAB account has at least one game linked
- Try refreshing your cookies
- Make sure you're using the correct account

### Sample Cookie Format

Here's what a sample cookie string looks like (with values hidden):

```
ltmid_v2=____; ltoken_v2=v2____; ltuid_v2=____; DEVICEFP=____; HYV_LOGIN_PLATFORM_LIFECYCLE_ID={}; HYV_LOGIN_PLATFORM_LOAD_TIMEOUT={}; HYV_LOGIN_PLATFORM_TRACKING_MAP={}; _HYVUUID=____; _MHYUUID=____; mi18nLang=en-us; account_id_v2=____; account_mid_v2=____; cookie_token_v2=v2____; HYV_LOGIN_PLATFORM_OPTIONAL_AGREEMENT={}
