## General

### Do I need to add the bot to use it?

No. You just need to be in a Discord server where HoYoVista is already added. If you want to use the bot in DMs or add it to your own server, you can [invite it](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1267369071444492309) - when you click the link, choose "Add to Server" instead of "Add to My Apps". This allows you to use the bot in DMs and across all your servers.

### Is HoYoVista safe? Will it steal my account?

Entering your cookies into HoYoVista is **your** decision. HoYoVista only uses your HoYoLAB cookies to talk to official HoYoLAB/HoYoverse APIs, the same way the HoYoLAB website does. The bot is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/ScobbleQ/HoYoVista), so its behavior can be reviewed.

### How does HoYoVista work?

HoYoLAB uses cookies to authenticate your account. HoYoVista uses your cookies to simulate the same behavior as the HoYoLAB website to obtain and perform actions on your behalf.

### Which games are supported?

HoYoVista supports Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Honkai Impact 3rd, and Zenless Zone Zero. Not every command supports every game. See [Supported Games](/docs/supported-games) for details.

## Account & Linking

### "You are not registered"

Use `/register` first. You must register before using `/hoyolink` or any other command that needs your account.

### "No linked games found" / "No cookies found"

Link your HoYoLAB account with `/hoyolink`. You need to provide your HoYoLAB cookies; see [Getting HoYoLAB Cookies](/docs/getting-cookies) for step-by-step instructions.

### "The cookies provided are invalid or incomplete"

- Copy the **entire** cookie string from the browser (everything after `Cookie:` in the request headers).
- Make sure you have the required cookies: `ltmidV2`, `ltokenV2`, `ltuidV2`.
- Try logging out of HoYoLAB and logging back in, then get fresh cookies and try again.

### "No games found linked to this account"

Your HoYoLAB account must have at least one game linked (via the HoYoLAB website or app). Add a game there first, then try linking again.

## Check-in

### Check-in failed with an error code

- **Already checked in today:** You may have already claimed; try again tomorrow.
- **HoYoLAB/API issue:** Try again later. If it keeps failing, ask in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5rUsSZTyf2).

### Can I check in for all my games at once?

Yes. Use `/check-in` without choosing an account (or choose the option that means “all”) to check in for all linked games.

### How do I turn on automatic check-in?

Use `/settings` → Check-in Settings, then enable DM notifications (optional) and enable auto check-in for each game you want.

## Other Commands

### Profile/Income/Notes don't show my game

Some commands only support certain games (e.g. Profile and Income support Genshin Impact and Zenless Zone Zero). See [Supported Games](/docs/supported-games).

### How do I delete my data?

Unlink your HoYoLAB account with `/hoyolink` → Unlink. That removes your cookies and linked game data. For full details, see [Privacy & Data](/docs/privacy-and-data).
