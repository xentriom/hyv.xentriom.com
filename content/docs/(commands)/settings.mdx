## Settings Command

The `/settings` command allows you to customize your HoYoVista experience, including notifications, privacy, data collection, and automatic features.

### Usage

```

### Settings Categories

The settings are organized into several categories accessible via a dropdown menu:

#### General Settings

- Your own data is always visible to you

**Collect Analytics Data**

- Data helps identify bugs, usage patterns, and feature requests
- Also enables personalized end-of-year wrapped (similar to Spotify Wrapped)

### Rate Limiting

- Settings updates are rate-limited to prevent abuse

- You may need to wait a moment for changes to fully propagate
